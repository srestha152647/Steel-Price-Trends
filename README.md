economic normalization. Demand has not drastically increased compare to last few
years , but such sharp increase in metal prices has impacted all manufacturing
industries. Objective of this project is to understand relevant cost drivers and price
pattern to be monitored for price forecasting using domain knowledge , statistics and
machine learning techniques.
